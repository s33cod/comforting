      <h3>Home Safety Preparations</h3>
      <p>Preparing the home for winter is essential for senior safety:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure heating systems are functioning properly and efficiently</li>

        <li>Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Health and Wellness</h3>
      <p>Winter can take a toll on senior health, both physically and mentally. Here are key areas to focus on:</p>
